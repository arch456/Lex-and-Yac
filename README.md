# CSC-502 - Graduate-Project

The idea of this project is to implement an Interpreter for Cuppa1 language - one of the languages that we have covered in class and implement it using lex (ï¬‚ex) and yacc (bison) under Linux. The implementation language used is C. This project has been done on a Linux system - the virtual machine provided with the class 

Running the Interpreter:
$ yacc -d cuppa1.y

$ lex cuppa1.l

$ gcc y.tab.c -lm lex.yy.c

$ ./a.out < input_file.txt
